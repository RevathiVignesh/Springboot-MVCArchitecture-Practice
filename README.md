# Springboot-MVCArchitecture-Practice

This repository is a practice project for implementing **Spring Boot MVC Architecture** using clean and layered design principles.  
It is intended for learning and demonstrating how a real-world Spring Boot backend application is structured.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project follows a **layered MVC architecture**:

- **Controller Layer** – Handles HTTP requests and responses  
- **Service Layer** – Contains business logic  
- **Repository Layer** – Handles data access (mock implementation)  
- **DTOs** – Used for request and response data transfer  
- **Entities** – Represents domain models  

The application exposes a simple REST API to fetch payment details.
